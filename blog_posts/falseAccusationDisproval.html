                        <p>I do not, by any means, want to shift focus away from the violence women suffer in our societies, however, I want to talk to some of my male peers here. Men are more likely to be a victim of sexual assault than they are to be a "victim" of a false accusation. All men everywhere we hear the opposite of this fact being stated need to stop and tell our peers that, "No, that's not actually true. We're actually more likely to survive it than be falsely accused of it."</p>

                        <p>Also, let's just point out the fact that the perpetrators are overwhelmingly still men! Even when men are survivors of such offenses, it's still most likely to have been a man that commited the act. Our focus should be on educating boys properly, not just to protect women and girls, but to also protect men and boys! Anyone against this position only shows that they don't care about the welfare of anyone in our society and would rather a society where they're able to commit such despicable acts and it not be illegal.</p>

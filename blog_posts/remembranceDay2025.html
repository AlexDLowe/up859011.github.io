                        <p>The other day, I was heading back home from the gym and I looked across this park I was walking through to see a chorus of heads of heads just peeking above the shrubs. Next to them, a monumental cenotaph standing easily 15 metres tall. It was November 11th, Remembrance Day in the UK, and I had stumbled upon a small ceremony taking place "in honour of those who had fallen in service". Now, I personally am quite grateful for those that gave their lives fighting fascism in World War II. Politics aside... getting rid of Nazism is always a good thing.</p>

                        <p>But I found myself thinking about how fascism is completely resurgent in the UK and abroad. Reform and Farage's footsoldiers are abundant in every corner of this not-so-Great Britain.</p>

                        <p>Despite this, the only kids that were there, the future generation, were phenotypically either South Asian or Black. After the handful of soldiers gave their commemorations and lauded their fallen comrades, these kids were the first to lay their poppy wreath at the base of the cenotaph. Knowing that they were still here, still out and about, still showing up for these overwhelmingly White ceremonies, gave me hope. I, for about 10 minutes, forgot about Nigel Farage and his sycophants, and I was reminded of the future that we should all fight for. One where those kids can grow up safe, free from racism, and not having to lay wreaths for even more fallen soldiers.</p>
